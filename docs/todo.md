# Chatbot Features and Enhancements Plan

## 1. Knowledge Base
### 1.1 Add Questions
- Enable the bot to store and manage a growing set of user-taught questions.

### 1.2 Add Answers
- Allow users to associate answers with specific questions for future responses.

### 1.3 Knowledge Base Query Optimization
- Use advanced algorithms like **BM25** for efficient question matching and retrieval.
- Ensure low-latency queries even with large datasets.

## 2. Add Calculator
- Integrate a basic calculator module.
  - Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Advanced calculations (e.g., percentages, square roots, trigonometry).

---

## 3. Add Weather
- Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
  - Provide current weather updates.
  - Offer forecasts based on user location.

---

## 4. Add News
- Fetch and display current news headlines.
  - Use a news API (e.g., NewsAPI or Bing News).
  - Allow users to select topics of interest (e.g., technology, sports).

---

## 5. Dynamic Response Handling
- Enhance the `DynamicResponseHandler` module.
  - Add more nuanced responses based on user sentiment.
  - Incorporate time-based greetings and context-aware responses.

---

## 6. Add Open-Ended Conversations
- Integrate pre-trained NLP models (e.g., GPT-based models) to:
  - Handle open-ended, natural language interactions.
  - Provide meaningful and human-like responses.

---

## 7. Add Memory Persistence Beyond Knowledge Base
- **Description:** While the bot saves learned knowledge, it doesn’t remember conversational context beyond the session unless explicitly programmed.
- **Goal:**
  - Maintain session-based memory to track ongoing conversations.
  - Implement long-term memory for recurring users.
  - Store context in a database for continuity between sessions.

---

## 8. Keyword-Based Context Awareness
- Improve the bot’s ability to:
  - Understand and respond to new questions by analyzing the context of the conversation.
  - Use advanced keyword extraction and topic modeling techniques.

---

## 9. Add User Preferences
- Allow users to set their own preferences (e.g., favorite topics, frequently asked questions).
- Use these preferences to personalize the bot's responses.

---

## 10. Add Advanced Memory Management
- Enhance the memory management system to:
  - Handle long-term memory for recurring users.
  - Store context in a database for continuity between sessions.
  - Use advanced algorithms like **BM25** for efficient question matching and retrieval.

## Additional Enhancements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Implement robust error-catching mechanisms to ensure seamless user experience.
- Log errors with timestamps for debugging and troubleshooting.

### Multilingual Support
- Add support for multiple languages using libraries like **Google Translate API**.
- Enable users to switch languages dynamically during the conversation.

### User Personalization
- Store user preferences (e.g., favorite topics, frequently asked questions).
- Customize responses based on user behavior and interaction history.

### API Integrations
- Add plugins for tasks like:
  - Currency conversion.
  - Fitness tracking.
  - Social media updates.

### Testing and Optimization
- Regularly test the bot for:
  - Speed and accuracy.
  - User engagement and satisfaction.
- Optimize algorithms for low latency and high reliability.
